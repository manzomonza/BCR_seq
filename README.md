# LymphocyteSeq
Create R-package for the analysis of (ThermoFisher based) TCR- and BCR-sequencing results
BCR sequencing includes loci of IGH, IGK and IGL immunglobulin loci.
TCR sequencing includes TCR beta and gamma loci.
Both include information for their respective variable, joining and diversity alleles.
